## Question 1: Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer
In my opinion, the shop owner and I should be in contact in case there’s a big question but at first we should have talked a lot about what the shop owner exactly wants.


## Question 2: Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?
Yes, this is because the client can be satisfied watching the evolution of the project. A MPV could convince the customer that it is a good idea to pay for my services.


## Question 3: Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software? Explain.

## Question 4: What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with the definition of each.
- Discoverability: When you look at something, you should be able to discover what operations you can do.
