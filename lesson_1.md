# Lesson 1

## Drawing of a computer
This is my drawing of a computer as I know today Wed Aug 25 2021

I am showing a monitor, speakers, the keyboard, the tower, a fan, the hard disk and the memory of the computer. 



# Homework Aug 25

## ① Start watching the videos posted on the resource stream for Unit 1.  (Link #8 in the Learning Log)
/

## ② Research. What are variables in computer programming? What types of variables can we use in Python?
Variables are where data that is used in a program are stored and retrieved. It's a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.

Variables are used to save data and states, to assign values from one variable to another, to represent values within a mathematical expression and to show values on screen. 

There are different types of variables in Python: numbers (int, long, float, complex), strings, lists, booleans (True or False), tuples, dictionary and sets.

## ③ What are the four CTS?
The 4 Computational Thinking Skills are:

- Decomposition: turning a complex problem smaller, with manageable parts.
- Pattern recognition: finding similarities among and within problems.
- Abstraction: ignoring irrelevant details and focusing on the important information.
- Algorithms: rules step-by-step to find the solution to a problem
